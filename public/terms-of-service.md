# Terms of Service

**Last Updated: December 30, 2024**

## 1. Agreement to Terms

By accessing or using Privacy Policy Distiller ("the Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the Service.

## 2. Description of Service

Privacy Policy Distiller is a free, open-source web application that helps users understand privacy policies and terms of service documents. The Service:

- Analyzes privacy policy documents via URL or PDF upload
- Uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate plain-language summaries
- Identifies potential privacy risks and concerns
- Extracts key terms and definitions
- Runs entirely in your web browser (client-side application)
- Stores all data (settings, preferences, temporary analysis data) exclusively on your own device — we operate no servers that store user data

## 3. No Account Required

The Service does not require user registration or account creation. You can use the Service without providing any personal information. Any preferences or settings you configure are stored only on your own device and are not transmitted to us.

## 4. User Responsibilities

### 4.1 Acceptable Use
You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You agree NOT to:

- Use the Service to analyze documents you do not have the right to access
- Attempt to circumvent any security features of the Service
- Use the Service in any way that could damage, disable, or impair the Service
- Use automated systems to access the Service in a manner that sends more requests than a human could reasonably produce

### 4.2 API Keys
If you choose to use OpenRouter or other third-party LLM providers:
- You are responsible for obtaining and managing your own API keys
- You are responsible for any costs associated with your API usage
- You must comply with the terms of service of your chosen LLM provider
- API keys are stored only on your own device (in your browser's session storage) and are never transmitted to our servers — we have no access to them

## 5. Disclaimer of Warranties

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

### 5.1 AI-Generated Content
The Service uses artificial intelligence to analyze and summarize documents. You acknowledge that:

- AI-generated summaries may contain errors, omissions, or inaccuracies
- The Service does not provide legal advice
- Summaries should not be relied upon as a substitute for reading the original documents
- You should consult qualified legal professionals for legal matters

### 5.2 No Guarantee of Accuracy
We do not guarantee that:
- The analysis will be complete or accurate
- All privacy risks will be identified
- The Service will be available at all times
- The Service will be free from errors or interruptions

## 6. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE SERVICE OPERATORS, CONTRIBUTORS, OR AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM:

- Your use or inability to use the Service
- Any errors or omissions in the AI-generated analysis
- Unauthorized access to or alteration of your data
- Any third-party conduct on the Service
- Any other matter relating to the Service

## 7. Third-Party Services

The Service may interact with third-party services:

### 7.1 LLM Providers
- **OpenRouter**: If you provide an OpenRouter API key, document text is sent to OpenRouter's servers for analysis
- **Local LLMs (Ollama, LM Studio)**: If you use local LLM providers, document processing occurs on your own machine

### 7.2 CORS Proxies
When fetching documents from URLs, the Service may use third-party CORS proxy services. For sensitive documents, we recommend uploading PDFs directly rather than using URL fetching.

### 7.3 Third-Party Terms
Your use of third-party services is subject to their respective terms of service and privacy policies.

## 8. Intellectual Property

### 8.1 Software License
The Service is source-available software licensed under the MIT License with Commercial Product Restriction. This license:

- **Permits**: Personal use, professional use (as a tool), internal business use, educational use, nonprofit use, government use, and redistribution with the same license
- **Prohibits**: Incorporating the software into commercial products, offering it as a paid SaaS, or white-labeling for sale

The full license text is available in the LICENSE file in the project repository.

### 8.2 User Content
You retain all rights to documents you upload or analyze. The Service does not claim ownership of your content.

## 9. Modifications to Terms

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Changes will be effective immediately upon posting to the Service. Your continued use of the Service after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms.

## 10. Termination

We reserve the right to terminate or suspend access to the Service at any time, without notice, for any reason.

## 11. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with applicable laws, without regard to conflict of law principles.

## 12. Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.
