Our services include:Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google HomePlatforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating systemProducts that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google MapsYou can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.Information Google collectsWe want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our servicesWe collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.Things you create or provide to usWhen you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.Information we collect as you use our servicesYour apps, browsers & devicesWe collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.The information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you’re using your Android device.Your activityWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:Terms you search forVideos you watchViews and interactions with content and adsVoice and audio informationPurchase activityPeople with whom you communicate or share contentActivity on third-party sites and apps that use our servicesChrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google AccountIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.Go to Google AccountYour location informationWe collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:GPS and other sensor data from your deviceIP addressActivity on Google services, such as from your searches or places you label like home or workInformation about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devicesThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Timeline if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.We use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.Why Google collects dataWe use data to build better servicesWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:Provide our servicesWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.Maintain & improve our servicesWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.Develop new servicesWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.Provide personalized services, including content and adsWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.Go to My Ad CenterMeasure performanceWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.Communicate with youWe use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.Protect Google, our users, and the publicWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.We may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.Your privacy controlsYou have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's usedThis section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services.

They also provide the right to not be discriminated against for exercising these privacy rights. Additionally, the CCPA treats certain kinds of information, like health data, as sensitive; when users provide this information, Google only uses it for purposes permitted by the CCPA, like to provide services that are requested and expected by our users.The Washington My Health My Data Act and Nevada Senate Bill 370 provide specific rights in addition to those rights above, that apply to health information. When you provide this information, Google only processes it with your consent and allows you to withdraw your consent.We describe the choices you have to manage your privacy and data across Google’s services in Your privacy controls.

Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 is the date and time of the query.http://www.google.com/search?q=cars is the requested URL, including the search query.Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 is the browser and operating system being used.740674ce2123a969 is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).Unique identifiersA unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about how Google uses cookies.On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be managed in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.Additional ContextActivity on Google ServicesIf you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.You can view and control your Web & App Activity at My Activity.activity on third-party sites and apps that use our servicesWebsites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.You can learn more about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.ads you’ll find most usefulFor example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more about Google ads and why you may see particular ads.advertising and research services on their behalfFor example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.Android device with Google appsAndroid devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about Google Play Services.customized search resultsFor example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can learn more here. You may also get customized search results even when you’re signed out. If you don’t want this level of search customization, you can search and browse privately or turn off signed-out search personalization.deliver our servicesExamples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube videoWe use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google AccountPhotos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, collages, and other creations that you can share. Learn moreA flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your GmailWhen you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.detect abuseWhen we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including child sexual abuse and exploitation material), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.devicesFor example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.ensure and improveFor example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.ensure our services are working as intendedFor example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.Information about things near your deviceIf you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services. Learn morelegal process, or enforceable governmental requestLike other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our Transparency Report.make improvementsFor example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.may link informationGoogle Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic. Learn moreour usersFor example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights.

Learn morepayment informationFor example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account. Learn morePerformance of their ad campaigns.Learn more about the technologies used for advertising.personalized adsYou may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads. Learn morephone numberIf you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you. Learn morePlaces you label like home and workYou might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for ads.You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your Google Account.protect against abuseFor example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).publicly accessible sourcesFor example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.rely on cookies to function properlyFor example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected. Learn moresafety and reliabilitySome examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access. Learn moresensitive categoriesWhen showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like \"Cooking and Recipes\" or \"Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we require the same from advertisers that use our services.Sensor data from your deviceYour device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about how we use location information.servers around the worldFor example, we operate data centers located around the world to help keep our products continuously available for users.services to make and receive calls or send and receive messagesExamples of these services include:Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemailGoogle Meet, for making and receiving video callsGmail, for sending and receiving emailsGoogle Chat, for sending and receiving messagesGoogle Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messagesGoogle Fi, for a phone planshow trendsWhen lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms. Learn moresimilar information related to your physical or mental healthIf you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.specific Google servicesFor example, you can delete your blog from Blogger or a Google Site you own from Google Sites. You can also delete reviews you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.specific partnersFor example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.

For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone. Learn moreIf you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.Views and interactions with content and adsFor example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.Voice and audio informationFor example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation. Learn moreyour activity on other sites and appsThis activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your account settings and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.Learn more about how Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps.closeOpens in a new tab(opens a footnote)GoogleAbout GooglePrivacyTermsTransparency CenterEnglishAfrikaansBahasa IndonesiaBahasa MelayuCatalàČeštinaDanskDeutschEestiEnglishEnglish (India)English (United Kingdom)EspañolEspañol (Latinoamérica)EuskaraFilipinoFrançaisFrançais (Canada)GaeilgeGalegoHrvatskiIsizuluÍslenskaItalianoKiswahiliLatviešuLietuviųMagyarMaltiNederlandsNorskPolskiPortuguês (Brasil)Português (Portugal)RomânăSlovenčinaSlovenščinaSrpskiSuomiSvenskaTiếng ViệtTürkçeঅসমীয়াΕλληνικάБългарскиଓଡିଆРусскийСрпскиУкраїнська‫עברית‬‫اردو‬‫العربية‬‫فارسی‬አማርኛमराठीहिन्दीবাংলাગુજરાતીதமிழ்తెలుగుಕನ್ನಡമലയാളംไทย한국어中文 (香港)中文（简体中文）中文（繁體中文）日本語Google appsMain menu"

    "brief": "Google collects a lot of information about you – things you give them (like your name, email, photos, payment details), data about how you use Google services (searches, videos you watch, apps you open, device type, location, and even voice recordings), and some publicly‑available info. They use this data to run and improve their products, give you personalized results and ads, keep the services secure, and to meet legal obligations. You can see, edit, export or delete most of this information through your Google Account, and you can adjust what’s saved or used for ads via the Privacy Checkup, Activity Controls, and My Ad Center. Google generally does not sell your personal data, but may share it with your consent, with partners who process it for Google, or when required by law or to protect safety. They protect your data with encryption, two‑step verification, and other security measures, and they retain it only as long as needed for the purposes described.",
    "detailed": "**Plain‑Language Summary of Google’s Privacy Policy (effective Dec 11 2025)**  \n\nBelow is a quick‑read guide that breaks the policy into its main parts, explains what Google is doing with your data, and tells you what you can do about it.  Think of it as a “user‑friendly cheat sheet” you can keep handy when you’re setting up a new account or just want to check your privacy settings.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What This Policy Covers  \n\n- **All Google products and services** (Search, YouTube, Gmail, Maps, Android, Chrome, Google Home, etc.) **and any third‑party sites that use Google tools** (ads, analytics, embedded maps, etc.).  \n- It **does not apply** to services that have a separate privacy notice (e.g., some partner apps) or to the privacy practices of other companies that advertise on Google.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What Information Google Collects  \n\n| Category | Examples | When It’s Collected |\n|----------|----------|---------------------|\n| **Account basics** | Name, email, password, phone number, payment info | When you create a Google Account or add details later |\n| **Device & browser data** | Device model, OS, IP address, unique IDs, browser type, app version, crash reports | Every time a Google app or service talks to Google’s servers |\n| **Activity data** | Search queries, YouTube videos watched, maps searches, voice commands, Chat messages, location history, ad clicks, Chrome history (if synced) | While you’re signed‑in **or** signed‑out (linked to a random ID) |\n| **Location information** | GPS, Wi‑Fi/cell tower data, IP‑based location, “home”/“work” places you label | When location services are on or you manually set a place |\n| **Content you create** | Emails, photos, docs, videos, comments, calendar events | Whenever you upload, compose, or share something |\n| **Communications** | Call logs, SMS logs, video‑call metadata | When you use Google Voice, Meet, Duo, etc. |\n| **Health & fitness data** | Heart rate, steps, sleep, weight (Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Google Fit) | Only if you use those health‑related products |\n| **Publicly available info** | News articles, public web pages, business listings | When Google crawls the web or receives data from trusted partners |\n| **Inferred data** | Interests, ad‑interest categories, “people who matter to you” | Built from the above activity (e.g., “you often watch cooking videos”) |\n\n*If you’re **not signed in**, the data is still collected but stored under a random identifier rather than your name.*\n\n---\n\n## 3. Why Google Collects the Data  \n\n1. **To deliver the service you asked for** – e.g., showing search results, loading a YouTube video, routing a call.  \n2. **To keep the service running smoothly** – fixing bugs, detecting outages, improving performance.  \n3. **To improve or build new products** – using patterns from many users to train AI (Google Translate, Gemini, etc.).  \n4. **To personalize your experience** – recommended videos, custom news, “smart” suggestions in Gmail/Calendar.  \n5. **To show you relevant ads** (if you’ve not turned this off).  Google never uses content from Gmail, Drive, or Photos for ad targeting.  \n6. **For analytics & measurement** – helping advertisers see how well their ads performed (aggregated, not personally identifying).  \n7. **For security & fraud prevention** – spotting spam, malware, suspicious log‑ins, stolen credentials.  \n8. **To comply with legal obligations** – responding to court orders, law‑enforcement requests, or other legal duties.\n\n*Google will ask for your explicit consent before using your data for anything **outside** these purposes.*\n\n---\n\n## 4. Your Privacy Controls (What You Can Turn On/Off)\n\n| Control | Where to Find It | What It Does |\n|---------|-------------------|--------------|\n| **Privacy Checkup** | Google Account → Privacy Checkup | Guided tour of the most important settings (activity, ads, location, etc.) |\n| **Activity Controls** | Google Account → Data & privacy → Activity controls | Toggle saving of Web & App Activity, YouTube History, Location History, Voice & Audio Activity. |\n| **Ad Settings (My Ad Center)** | Google Account → Ad settings | Choose which interests are used for ads, turn off personalized ads, opt‑out of “ad personalization” entirely. |\n| **Location Settings** | Device Settings → Location (or Google Account → Location) | Turn Google location services on/off, control “Location History,” delete saved places (home/work). |\n| **Shared Endorsements** | Google Account → Shared endorsements | Decide whether your name/photo appear next to reviews, comments, or in ads. |\n| **Third‑party app access** | Google Account → Security → Third‑party apps with account access | Review and revoke permissions you granted to external apps or sites. |\n| **Incognito/Private mode** | Chrome → New Incognito Window (or similar in other browsers) | Prevents Chrome from storing browsing history, cookies, or form data on the device. (Note: sites using Google services may still send some data to Google.) |\n| **Browser cookie controls** | Browser settings | Block/allow all cookies, clear cookies, or see when Google sets a cookie. |\n\n**Tip:** The easiest way to see everything in one place is the **Google Account dashboard** (myaccount.google.com). From there you can view, edit, or delete almost any type of data Google holds about you.\n\n---\n\n## 5. How Google Shares Your Information  \n\n| Who Gets It | When It Happens | What’s Shared |\n|-------------|-----------------|---------------|\n| **You (by choice)** | You share a video publicly, send an email, add a collaborator, etc. | Any content you deliberately make public or share with others. |\n| **Domain administrators** (e.g., school or work) | If you use a Google Workspace or Education account. | They can view, manage, and even delete data in your account (subject to their policies). |\n| **Service providers** (data‑center operators, customer‑support vendors, transcription services) | Ongoing operations. | Only the data needed to perform the service, under strict contracts and confidentiality rules. |\n| **Advertisers & measurement partners** | When you view or click ads, or when they request performance reports. | Aggregated, non‑identifying data (e.g., “10,000 users in NYC saw this ad”). No name, email, or content from Drive/Gmail is shared. |\n| **Legal & government requests** | When required by law, subpoena, court order, or emergency. | Only the data needed to comply; Google reviews each request and often pushes back on overly broad demands. |\n| **Publicly available sources** | Google crawls the web or receives data from trusted partners (e.g., business directories). | Information that’s already public (e.g., a newspaper article about you). |\n| **Merger/acquisition** | If Google is bought or sells a part of its business. | You’ll be notified; the new owner must follow the same privacy rules. |\n\n**Bottom line:** *Your personal identifiers (name, email, phone) are only shared with third parties when you explicitly consent, when a domain admin controls your account, or when required by law.*\n\n---\n\n## 6. Keeping Your Information Secure  \n\n- **Encryption** – All data is encrypted while moving between your device and Google’s servers (HTTPS).  \n- **Built‑in security tools** – 2‑Step Verification, Security Checkup, Safe Browsing, password alerts, and device‑level protections.  \n- **Access controls** – Only employees and contractors who need the data can see it, and they’re bound by strict confidentiality contracts.  \n- **Regular audits** – Google reviews its processes, physical data‑center security, and third‑party contracts.  \n\nIf Google detects a security problem affecting you (e.g., a suspicious login), they’ll email or notify you and give steps to protect your account.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Exporting, Deleting, and Retaining Your Data  \n\n| Action | How to Do It | What Happens |\n|--------|---------------|--------------|\n| **Export your data** | Google Takeout (takeout.google.com) – select the services you want, choose format, download zip file. | You get a copy of everything Google stores for you (emails, photos, docs, etc.). |\n| **Delete specific items** | Use the product UI (e.g., delete a photo in Photos, delete a YouTube video, clear a single search in My Activity). | Item is removed from active servers; a copy may linger in backup for a short period before being overwritten. |\n| **Delete an entire service** | Google Account → Data & privacy → Delete a Google service. | All data for that service is removed (e.g., delete Gmail, delete Drive). |\n| **Delete your whole Google Account** | Google Account → Delete your account. | All data across all Google services is scheduled for deletion. Some legally required records (e.g., tax info) may be kept longer. |\n| **Automatic deletion** | Activity Controls → Web & App Activity → “Auto‑delete” (choose 3‑, 18‑, or 36‑month). | Google automatically erases activity older than the period you set. |\n| **Inactive Account Manager** | Set a “legacy contact” who can get access after 3‑12 months of inactivity. | Helps you avoid losing data if you can’t log in later. |\n\n**Retention:**  \n- **User‑controlled data** (photos, emails, docs) stays until you delete it.  \n- **Log data & analytics** (e.g., ad‑click logs) are usually deleted or anonymized after a few weeks‑months.  \n- **Legal/financial records** (e.g., payment receipts) may be kept for up to 7 years to meet tax or regulatory rules.  \n\nGoogle promises not to keep personal data longer than necessary for the purpose it was collected.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Your Rights Under U.S. State Privacy Laws (and similar worldwide)  \n\n- **Access & download** – Request a copy of the data Google holds about you. (Takeout does this.)  \n- **Correction** – Edit inaccurate personal info (name, address, etc.) in your account.  \n- **Deletion** – Ask Google to erase data (right to be forgotten) where applicable.  \n- **Opt‑out of profiling/targeted ads** – Turn off ad personalization in My Ad Center.  \n- **Do‑not‑discriminate** – Google can’t treat you worse for exercising any of these rights.  \n- **Specific health‑data protections** – If you share health metrics via Fitbit, Google can only use them with your consent and you can withdraw that consent at any time.  \n\nIf a request is denied, Google must give you a clear explanation and a way to appeal.\n\n---\n\n## 9. How to Stay in Control (Step‑by‑Step Checklist)\n\n1. **Run the Privacy Checkup** – It walks you through the most important settings in ~5 minutes.  \n2. **Review Activity Controls** – Decide if you want Google to save Web & App Activity, Location History, and YouTube History. Turn off anything you don’t need.  \n3. **Set Ad Preferences** – Go to My Ad Center → turn off “Ad personalization” if you prefer non‑targeted ads.  \n4. **Check “Shared Endorsements”** – Disable if you don’t want your name/photo shown next to reviews or in ads.  \n5. **Audit Third‑Party Access** – Revoke any apps or sites you no longer use (Google Account → Security → Third‑party apps).  \n6. **Enable 2‑Step Verification** – Adds a second factor (SMS, authenticator app, or security key) to protect login.  \n7. **Use Incognito/Private Browsing** for one‑off searches you don’t want tied to your account.  \n8. **Periodically Export Your Data** – Keep a backup of important files, especially before making big deletions.  \n9. **Set Auto‑Delete** for old activity if you don’t need a permanent history.  \n10. **Read the “About this Policy” section** if you ever see a new version—Google must tell you what’s changed and can’t take away your existing rights without consent.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Bottom Line for the Everyday User  \n\n- **Google collects a lot of data** because its services are free and heavily personalized.  \n- **You have granular control** over most of what is collected, how it’s used, and who it’s shared with.  \n- **The default settings tend to be “on”** (saving activity, personalized ads).  If you prefer more privacy, go into your Google Account and turn those switches off.  \n- **Your data is protected** by encryption, internal security policies, and regular audits, but no system is 100 % immune—use strong passwords and two‑factor authentication.  \n- **You can always get a copy of your data, delete it, or ask Google to stop using it for certain purposes**—the tools are built into the account dashboard.  \n\nBy taking a few minutes each month to review the settings above, you can keep the benefits of Google’s services while limiting how much of your personal life is stored and used behind the scenes.",

Our services include:Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google HomePlatforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating systemProducts that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google MapsYou can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.Information Google collectsWe want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our servicesWe collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.Things you create or provide to usWhen you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.Information we collect as you use our servicesYour apps, browsers & devicesWe collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.The information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you’re using your Android device.Your activityWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:Terms you search forVideos you watchViews and interactions with content and adsVoice and audio informationPurchase activityPeople with whom you communicate or share contentActivity on third-party sites and apps that use our servicesChrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google AccountIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.Go to Google AccountYour location informationWe collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:GPS and other sensor data from your deviceIP addressActivity on Google services, such as from your searches or places you label like home or workInformation about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devicesThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Timeline if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.We use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.Why Google collects dataWe use data to build better servicesWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:Provide our servicesWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.Maintain & improve our servicesWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.Develop new servicesWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.Provide personalized services, including content and adsWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.Go to My Ad CenterMeasure performanceWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.Communicate with youWe use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.Protect Google, our users, and the publicWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.We may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.Your privacy controlsYou have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's usedThis section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services.

Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 is the date and time of the query.http://www.google.com/search?q=cars is the requested URL, including the search query.Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 is the browser and operating system being used.740674ce2123a969 is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).Unique identifiersA unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about how Google uses cookies.On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be managed in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.Additional ContextActivity on Google ServicesIf you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.You can view and control your Web & App Activity at My Activity.activity on third-party sites and apps that use our servicesWebsites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.You can learn more about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.ads you’ll find most usefulFor example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more about Google ads and why you may see particular ads.advertising and research services on their behalfFor example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.Android device with Google appsAndroid devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about Google Play Services.customized search resultsFor example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can learn more here. You may also get customized search results even when you’re signed out. If you don’t want this level of search customization, you can search and browse privately or turn off signed-out search personalization.deliver our servicesExamples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube videoWe use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google AccountPhotos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, collages, and other creations that you can share.

We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.detect abuseWhen we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including child sexual abuse and exploitation material), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.devicesFor example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.ensure and improveFor example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.ensure our services are working as intendedFor example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.Information about things near your deviceIf you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services. Learn morelegal process, or enforceable governmental requestLike other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our Transparency Report.make improvementsFor example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.may link informationGoogle Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

Learn morePlaces you label like home and workYou might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for ads.You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your Google Account.protect against abuseFor example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).publicly accessible sourcesFor example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.rely on cookies to function properlyFor example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected. Learn moresafety and reliabilitySome examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access. Learn moresensitive categoriesWhen showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like \"Cooking and Recipes\" or \"Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we require the same from advertisers that use our services.Sensor data from your deviceYour device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about how we use location information.servers around the worldFor example, we operate data centers located around the world to help keep our products continuously available for users.services to make and receive calls or send and receive messagesExamples of these services include:Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemailGoogle Meet, for making and receiving video callsGmail, for sending and receiving emailsGoogle Chat, for sending and receiving messagesGoogle Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messagesGoogle Fi, for a phone planshow trendsWhen lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time.

Learn moreIf you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.Views and interactions with content and adsFor example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.Voice and audio informationFor example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation. Learn moreyour activity on other sites and appsThis activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your account settings and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.Learn more about how Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps.closeOpens in a new tab(opens a footnote)GoogleAbout GooglePrivacyTermsTransparency CenterEnglishAfrikaansBahasa IndonesiaBahasa MelayuCatalàČeštinaDanskDeutschEestiEnglishEnglish (India)English (United Kingdom)EspañolEspañol (Latinoamérica)EuskaraFilipinoFrançaisFrançais (Canada)GaeilgeGalegoHrvatskiIsizuluÍslenskaItalianoKiswahiliLatviešuLietuviųMagyarMaltiNederlandsNorskPolskiPortuguês (Brasil)Português (Portugal)RomânăSlovenčinaSlovenščinaSrpskiSuomiSvenskaTiếng ViệtTürkçeঅসমীয়াΕλληνικάБългарскиଓଡିଆРусскийСрпскиУкраїнська‫עברית‬‫اردو‬‫العربية‬‫فارسی‬አማርኛमराठीहिन्दीবাংলাગુજરાતીதமிழ்తెలుగుಕನ್ನಡമലയാളംไทย한국어中文 (香港)中文（简体中文）中文（繁體中文）日本語Google appsMain menu"
